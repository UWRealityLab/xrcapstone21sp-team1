## Blog Post #6- Working on our target product - May 13th, 2021

<hr>

### What we accomplished
After finishing up our MVP last week - this week we started work on our target product. We continued work on avatar customization, menus, maps, and started work on implementing another game mode (classic dodgeball).

#### Avatar Customization, Rooms, Teams, and Classic Dodgeball Game Mode
We finished work on rooms so that users are able to specify which room they want to join, the team they want to play on (i.e. - picking 1 of 2 available teams), and their username. Their username and avatar color (which is specific to which team they have selected) will be synced for all users in the room. Multiple matches of dodgeball are able to be played as their are multiple rooms as well. We initially struggled and spent quite a bit of time getting avatar colors and usernames to correctly sync for all player views. This was due to a race condition but we were able to figure it out.

With the addition of teams - we also started work on implementing teamed dodgeball (i.e. - classic mode). This mode allows users to play the classic game of dodgeball we are all familiar with - where users are placed on teams and the goal is to eliminate all of the other players on the other team. We also purchased a dodgeball court model.

#### In-Game Menus
We also continued work on in-game menus.

### Plans for next week
We are a bit behind on our initial plans from our PRD. However - we think that the work we have done this week has been helpful in laying the foundation for a smooth and friendly user experience. Additionally - there have been some unforseen setbacks in the lack of documentation and general novelty of the frameworks we are using which have required more time to understand then initially planned for. Our plan for next week is to continue work on classic mode and start work on power ups.
