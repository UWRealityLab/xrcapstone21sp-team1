## Blog Post #6- Working on our target product - May 13th, 2021

<hr>

### What we accomplished
After finishing up our MVP last week - this week we started work on our target product. We continued work on avatar customization, menus, maps, and started work on implementing another game mode (classic dodgeball).

#### Avatar Customization, Rooms, Teams, and Classic Dodgeball Game Mode
We finished work on rooms so that users are able to specify which room they want to join, the team they want to play on (i.e. - picking 1 of 2 available teams), and their username. Their username and avatar color (which is specific to which team they have selected) will be synced for all users in the room. Multiple matches of dodgeball are able to be played as there are multiple rooms as well. We initially struggled and spent quite a bit of time getting avatar colors and usernames to correctly sync for all player views. This was due to a race condition but we were able to figure it out.

With the addition of teams - we also started work on implementing teamed dodgeball (i.e. - classic mode). This mode allows users to play the classic game of dodgeball we are all familiar with - where users are placed on teams and the goal is to eliminate all of the other players on the other team. We also purchased a dodgeball court model.

#### In-Game Menus
We also continued work on in-game menus.

### Plans for next week
This week not too much progress due to syncing issues - had to contact networked aframe people.
Plans for this weekend: finish up classic mode and ideally finish up lobby.
Plans for next week: wowrk on capture the flag. (move power ups to week 9 or just don't do it). Adding capture the flag is really important.
Capture the flag map later - no hiding spots in classic mode. regular gym setting is fine - fix walls and ceiling. make walls and ceiling look better. green button is in lobby room - press button then we rebuild the map in javascript rather then html - delete everything and put it back. rebuild the map.

map: floor the same. use 3d picture for sky and use boxes to show bleachers on the side.

We are a bit behind on our initial plans from our PRD. However - we think that the work we have done this week has been helpful in laying the foundation for a smooth and friendly user experience which is what we aiming for in our final product. Additionally - there have been some unforseen setbacks in the lack of documentation and general novelty of the frameworks we are using which have required more time to understand then initially planned for. Our plan for next week is to continue work on classic mode and start work on power ups.
