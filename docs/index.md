# What is VR Dodgeball?

VR Dodgeball is a networked multiplayer game  built with AFRAME where players can play virtual dodgeball. This gives people a fun way to exercise and destress, and interact with others, especially in a pandemic where in-person games of dodgeball aren't as practical. VR Dodgeball is currently available on the Oculus Quest 2.
