# What is VR Dodgeball?

VR Dodgeball is a networked multiplayer game  built with AFRAME where players can play virtual dodgeball. This gives people a fun way to exercise and destress, and interact with others, especially in a pandemic where in-person games of dodgeball aren't as practical. VR Dodgeball is currently available on the Oculus Quest 2. Demo our project with all of our most recent additions [here](https://aba40.glitch.me/)! Note: only available for play on the headset.
