# What is VR Dodgeball?

(feel free to add to this if you want)

VR Dodgeball is a networked multiplayer game where players can throw virtual dodgeballs at each other. This gives people a fun way to exercise and destress, especially in a pandemic where in-person games of dodgeball aren't as practical.
