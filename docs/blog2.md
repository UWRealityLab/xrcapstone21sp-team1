### Individual work log

- **Timothy:** I tried to update the [original Croquet demo](https://croquet-hello-webvr.glitch.me/) to support physics collisions between users using Cannon.js (my new version can be found [here](https://croquet-aframe-cannon.glitch.me/)). After a while, I decided it would be better to create a new [demo](https://super-hands-croquet.glitch.me/) from the ground up that used aframe's physics engine and Croquet instead of Cannon.js because it would work better with [super hands](https://github.com/wmurphyrd/aframe-super-hands-component), which we're (currently) using for throwing and catching the balls. (As it turns out, aframe's physics engine is based on Cannon.js, so this might have been a moot point). In this demo, players are represented by blue spheres, and each player can see other players move. Players can also throw balls at each other (see the ["What we accomplished"](#what-we-accomplished) section for more details about this demo).
