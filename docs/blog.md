## Blog Post #1 - Idea Formulation - April 6th, 2021

### What we accomplished 

This week we spent a lot of time thinking about and iterating on our capstone project design. We all met together and iterated through a few different possible ideas ranging from a VR farming game very similar to Stardew Valley, mini-games which a user could play while working out, a VR application which simulates being at the school/office, an educational app which would educate people on the effects of overfishing, etc. Initially, we all decided on pursuing the [earth creating game](https://dan-ball.jp/en/javagame/ee/). The earth creating game is a simulation game that creates the Earth using various dots on the field of gravity. We thought this would be interesting to recreate in VR. We spent a pretty significant amount of time thinking about how to implement this in VR using WebXR. We researched how to recreate the game - particularly trying to see how we could make it using AFRAME. We created a small application with 20,000 spheres using glitch and this was too computationally intensive. After determining this wouldn't be too feasible to recreate and also discussing our idea with the course staff, we decided to switch our project idea to VR Dodgeball.

The project we are now pursuing is VR Dodgeball - based on the classic game dodgeball but instead in VR. We decided to settle on recreating dodgeball as we felt the idea was simple enough to expand upon and also allowed people to connect with their friends or family over a light-hearted game. We aim to implement a few core features such as multiplayer mode using the croquet API, different maps, and character customization. We spent the rest of the week discussing how we would implement this using the technologies we've learned thus far in class. We researched different physics engines to use with our app for collision detection and decided to use cannon.js to start. We also spent a good amount of time on creating our website, fleshing out the main ideas on our project requirements doc, and working on this blog post! We still need to work out a few aspects of our design, but we feel fairly confident in where we are right now. 

### Plans for next week

Our main goal for next week is to complete our project requirements doc which will give us a good plan moving forward in where we should be throughout the rest of the course - to ensure we finish our project on time. We also aim to create a small demo application integrating the physics engine into an existing project we have done for throwing a ball (i.e. - collision detection). If we have time - we would also like to integrate the croquet api as well.
